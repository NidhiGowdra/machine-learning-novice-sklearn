title: "Dimensionality Reduction"
teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How can we perform unsupervised learning with dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principle Component Analyis (PCA), 
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection  (UMAP) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)?"
objectives:
- "Recall that most data is inherently multidimensional"
- "Understand that reducing the number of dimensions can simplify modelling and allow classifications to be performed."
- "Understand that dimensionality reduction is helpful in performing data visualization and interpretation"
- "Apply PCA, t-SNE and UMAP with Scikit Learn to an example dataset."
- "Evaluate the relative peformance of PCA, t-SNE and UMAP."
keypoints:
- "PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique"
- "t-SNE is another dimensionality reduction technique that is more general than PCA"
- "UMAP is another dimensionality reduction technique that allows for nonlinear embeddings"
